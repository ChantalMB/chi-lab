My name is Chantal and I’m a third year student studying History with a minor in Computer Science. I’m primarily interested in social history, such as daily lives and the effects that expansion of civilization had on them as empires grew. I’m hoping to use this fellowship to not only gain experience in the field of research, but also to combine my interests in the historic and digital by examining urban theory in relation to city building games set in both modern and ancient times. Additionally, I hope to apply my technical abilities to look at other open source city building games and their potential to be used to create an accurate or exploratory model of classical civilization.
