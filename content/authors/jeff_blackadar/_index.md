Jeff Blackadar is a part-time MA student in the Department of History, pursuing an MA in History with [Data Science](https://carleton.ca/cuids/). As an undergrad, he published a lesson on [MySQL with R](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/getting-started-with-mysql-using-r) in [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org). His work on the CCAD project will explore techniques of in-painting and image completion on archaeological photography, and the ways these images can be used for photogrammetry and the exploration of 'fuzziness' in computational imagination / archaeological reconstruction.
