# SimRomanCity

This year, the [Graham Undergraduate Digital History Research Fellowship](http://grahamresearchfellow.org/) was advertised in conjuction with what Dr. Graham is calling 'the [SimRomanCity Project](/project/simromancity/)'. Graham has [experimented on and off over the years with the power of modding](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/12544152.0001.001/--pastplay-teaching-and-learning-history-with-technology?g=dculture;trgt=div2_ch10;view=fulltext) existing games to play up particular aspects of the past; when he came across a port of [SimCity to js/html5](http://www.graememcc.co.uk/micropolisJS/) he decided it was time to give it another go! This year's fellows are going to at least _start_ with this, but in keeping with the philosophy behind the Fellowship, they'll be free to take it whereever they like! 

There was quite a bit of interest from the student body this year, and there were several applications. The Fellows will be announced on Friday. Stay tuned!
