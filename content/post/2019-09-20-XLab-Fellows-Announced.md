Dr. Graham is pleased to announce that the Inaugrual X-Lab Fellowships have been awarded to two outstanding History students, Vanessa Finney and Lauren Rollit. Vanessa is a fourth year history student with a minor in archaeology, interested in the perceptions of the body throughout history and application of technological advancements as teaching tools for history. She hopes to use this fellowship to gain skills and knowledge in online and digital media that will aid with future research into digital pedagogy. Lauren is the social media coordinator for the Ottawa Historical Society, and has worked in public history for the Department of Canadian Heritage, and the Lambton House Museum. She has as part of her coursework at Carleton used corpus linguistics on Canadian newspapers to explore aspects of the 19th century Canadian economy. She is interested in the intersections of gender and economic history, and digital history methods. Vanessa and Laruen will be working with Dr. Graham on a variety of projects, including testing the use of methods developed in the BoneTrade Project to other classes of archaeological materials.
