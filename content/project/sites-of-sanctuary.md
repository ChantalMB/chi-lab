In Ancient Greece, sanctuaries were often undefined spaces such as caves, springs and mountain peaks. In Medieval England, churches were sanctuaries where individuals in flight from the law could seek, and receive protection.

Today, discussions of sanctuary focus largely on the idea of sanctuary cities to protect undocumented migrants.

Sanctuary, both in terms of its significance and its associated practices has evolved dramatically over the years. The "Sites of Sanctuary" research project documents, analyses, changes in the scope and practice of sanctuary by examining the history of refuge and protection in Canada from the 1800s to the present
