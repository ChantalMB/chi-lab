A sub project of Matt Milner's [Nanohistory Project](https://www.nanohistory.org//), we are looking at reconstructing collecting histories within this experimental methodology. From the Nanohistory site:

> NanoHistory is a cultural network building environment where historians and scholars, or anyone, can document the connections between people, organizations, places, and things over time. It's more than just a 'social network' focused on personal relationships. It envisions a digital history that documents the smallest objects of interest to historical scholars: an event, or interaction. Defining an event can be messy, but NanoHistory sees it as something that doesn’t necessarily have a title or a name – it just is. NanoHistory automatically links these events together to form network representations of the past.
