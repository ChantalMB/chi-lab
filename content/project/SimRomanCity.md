SimCity has had enormous influence in games and beyond, and in many ways our everyday thinking about how cities work can be traced back to the way SimCity modeled urban systems. This project involves students who hold the Graham Undergraduate Research Fellowship, and lets them take the lead in designing teaching modules that explores the history of SimCity and Will Wrightâ€™s influences, and discuss what that might mean for how we understand ancient cities, and how the study of the ancient city is entangled with these particular models of modern, Western cities that SimCity represents.
